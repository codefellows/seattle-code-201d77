# Notes on your FIRST Final Presentation!

- 15 min informational presentation with out 5-8 of the time spent demoing your app. 
- everyone introduces themselves with a 60 sec pitch 
- show a series of slides/demo

## Slide template
- Here is a template you can use for slides. Feel free to modify this if any of you are talented in this area. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NeXKKEpjK2DDme8EwlZBsJndUqIgGYzWrY6FAYtNTf0/edit#slide=id.g8526846ab1_1_42

## Tips for a polished presentation - general
- Try to split talking time evenly so everyone gets a chance to present
- Know what portions you will be presenting - be prepared
- Know who is speaking before and after you - pass the mic to the next presenter and thank the previous one "Thank you Kevin" "Next up, Michael will be demonstrating our app"
- It is ok to write a script if you need one, but try to sound natural if you are refering to a script, practice your script with the demo person so you are fluid
- Look at your camera when speaking and pretend you are speaking to someone
- Project your voice and up your energy: believe me, I know this is exhausting, but it will keep the audience engaged
- Hand gestures can be good, be animated, but try not to rock in your chair or tap or any other distracting physical behavior. 
- Try not to "umm" or "like" - minimize filler speach, if you know you do this try to slow down
- Mic off when not talking, and camera off when your team is not presenting
- **DO NOT READ YOUR SLIDES** Use the slide as a bullet point and talk about the bullet point... I will demonstrate: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17mxYBAKPGCJwfT_glpJBMmgKuNoryoRaR-qdsodog3E/edit#slide=id.g87388cdd1b_2_53

## Tips for a polished presentation - slides/sections
- Use less words on your slides and give more details when you're talking about the slides instead. You don't want to force the audience to choose between reading your slides and listening to what you are saying. Keep the wording on the slides short and talk about the details of that slide instead.
- You will be doing your 60 second pitch so be prepared - either have your script memorized or put it somewhere you can read it while looking at the camera in general
- When talking about "challenges" frame them as things you overcame - focus on the solution
- When demoing your project, tell me what is going on behind the scenes, in the code. "When we click this button, the user is allowed to retrieve their previous entries from local storage..."
  - at the level that your grandma could enjoy but that another engineer will understad what you did

## Fun extras
- coordinated team backgrounds or outfits are always fun

### we will practice presentations thursday afternoon to give you a chance to work on them more if needed
- 230pm - 5pm

# Presentation Day Logistics

These tips were recommended by a recruiter who came and watched our presentations. There may be people in the audience who will be future job contacts, make sure you impress them!

## Guiding Principle
- Behave as if your future employer is watching.

## Dress-code:  
- Elevated dress is recommended. (We‚Äôre talking business casual vs. a pajama top/hoodie)

## Professionality: 
- No eating/drinking on camera üçî . 
- Mute yourself when not talking.
- Be aware of ‚Äòfiller‚Äô speech when presenting. "umm, like, so"

## Camera etiquette: 
- Cameras and Mics off if your team is not presenting.
- Try not to wiggle around, be aware of your face and body when your camera is on.

## ‚ÄúPassing the mic‚Äù: 
- ‚ÄúNAME, I‚Äôll pass it over to you‚Äù practice this in your run throughs so you will do it on presentation day.

## QA 
- I will watch the chat and Q&A for questions and moderate for you. I will try to evenly distribute questions but will also give you the opportunity to add to what someone else said.

## Logistics 
- use the link sent to **YOU** in your email to log in to the zoom call. 
- Double check today that you have that link, if not let me know so I can get you one. 
- Do not share your link with someone else
- **DO** invite your friends and family using this link https://www.eventbrite.com/e/201-virtual-demo-day-presentations-tickets-161714593703?aff=slack
